# agentic-research-assistant
A lightweight autonomous agent built using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 that automates academic research.

Developed an intelligent AI assistant capable of interpreting natural language research questions.

Integrated the arXiv API as a custom tool to retrieve top academic papers related to user queries.

Used LangChainâ€™s Tool + Agent framework to create an agent that autonomously searches, synthesizes, and presents academic insights.

Optimized for interpretability and ease of use via a CLI-based interactive workflow.

Supports future extension with additional tools (e.g., PDF generation, summarization agents, Streamlit UI).

Tech Stack: Python, LangChain, OpenAI GPT-3.5, arXiv API, dotenv
